<p>The router component in the Kong Gateway is a crucial element for traffic handling, allowing the definition of specific matching rules to identify and process client requests. As a core component of the gateway, the router plays a vital role in ensuring the functionality, flexibility, security as well as performance of the gateway.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the 3.0 version update of the Kong API Gateway, the routing system was completely rewritten in Rust — a memory-safe and efficient language. A concise DSL (Domain Specific Language) was designed to define routing rules efficiently, called the &ldquo;Expressions Router.&rdquo; The new design reduced the routing construction time by 75% when handling up to 10,000 routing rules, significantly decreasing from 20 seconds to 5 seconds.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Test Code Overflow Fix</title><link>https://rmmod.com/posts/test-code-overflow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 10:00:00 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://rmmod.com/posts/test-code-overflow/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This is a test page to demonstrate that the code block overflow issue has been fixed.</p>

<p>Rate limiting protects your APIs from inadvertent or malicious overuse by limiting how often each user can call the API. Without rate limiting, each user may make a request as often as they like, leading to &ldquo;spikes&rdquo; of requests that starve other consumers. Once enabled, rate limiting can only perform a fixed number of requests per second. A rate limiting algorithm helps automate the process.</p>

<p>Based on the ranking of popular languages on developing web crawlers (based on result numbers of relative repositories host on Github on February, 2013). Python or Ruby probably is a wise choice, the mainly speed limit of web crawler is network latency not CPU, so choose Python or Ruby as a language to develop a web crawler will make life easier. Python provide some standard libraries, they are very useful, such like urllib, httplib and regex, those libraries can handle lots of work.

The most important thing in FL(functional languages) is: <strong>&quot;<em>All data are immutable. All functions are pure.</em>&quot;</strong>  </p>
<h2 id="immutable-data"> Immutable Data</h2>
<p>Immutable data cannot be modified after being created. It has many advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inherently Thread safety</strong> Parallel programming is the nightmare of some programers, because different threads simultaneously access the same object can cause unexpected problem, such like a race conditions. The most famous and classical example is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#Example" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Bank Account Problem</a>
. Today we get more and more cores in our computers, so the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/06/scala-vs-erlang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">multi-core crisis</a>
 we need to face, some experts believe in the future, we using Scala or Erlang to deal with this crisis.Interesting thing is many &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; language is either the functional or support functional paradigm.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate side-effects</strong> There are so many reasons. Most important thing is global variables are difficult to understand. For example, if we want understand one functions in the non-trival project,  and we find a variable define in other place, so we will jump to the definition of this variable and other places where modify it, it will cost us more time to figure out what the exactly meaning of this function. So there is the same reason why the code is much easier to understand if we use immutable objects, because the scope of an immutable object is limited as possible. It will make our programming easier and more robust.</li>
</ol>
<p>  The programming experts from other languages also know we need use immutable data as more as possible: Joshua Bloch,the author of Effective Java, said, “If an object is immutable, it can be in only one state, and you win big.You never have to worry about what state the object is in, and you can share it freely, with no need for synchronization.” Scott Meyers, Effective C++, Item 3: <a href="http://codeidol.com/cpp/effective-cpp/Accustoming-Yourself-to-C/Item-3-Use-const-whenever-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Use <em>const</em> whenever possible</a>
. Other languages also use immutable data frequently, such like Python, the number/string/tuple types are immutable data, the String build-in class in Java is immutable too. But immutable data is inconvenient in some situation:</p>]]></description></item><item><title>How to use Python like Lisp</title><link>https://rmmod.com/posts/how-to-use-python-like-lisp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>guanlan</author><guid>https://rmmod.com/posts/how-to-use-python-like-lisp/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Lisp has some very effective way to get jobs done, this article give you a direct way to use Python like Lisp.</p>

<p>from:<a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/activa" title="Philippe Leybaert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">@activa</a>
</p>
<p>1.Google<br>
For technical problems, definitely check Google and Wikipedia. Use Baidu more if you want to see adult product ads.</p>
<p>2.Coworkers<br>
Ask coworkers for help. If your colleagues are helpful, technically skilled, and have encountered similar problems, their advice can be very valuable and might solve the problem immediately.</p>
<p>3.StackOverflow<br>
Search for answers on programming help websites, or post questions if you can&rsquo;t find answers. There are quite a lot of helpful people, but it seems this site has more Java/.Net questions.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
