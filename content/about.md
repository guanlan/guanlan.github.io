# About

Currently serve as Site Lead of Kong China and Director of Gateway at [Kong](https://konghq.com/).

I helped scale Kong from an open-source API gateway into a full-stack microservices platform, bridging open-source traction with enterprise adoption. I established and lead our Shanghai engineering hub (50+ engineers) from scratch, now a core engine driving innovation in API management and AI infrastructure.

Previously, I led edge engineering at [Cloudflare](http://cloudflare.com/), scaling systems that handle trillions of daily requests across CDN, WAF, and DDoS protection.

My background is in distributed systems, networks, and scaling resilient infrastructure.
