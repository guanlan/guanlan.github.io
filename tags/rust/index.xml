&lt;p>The router component in the Kong Gateway is a crucial element for traffic handling, allowing the definition of specific matching rules to identify and process client requests. As a core component of the gateway, the router plays a vital role in ensuring the functionality, flexibility, security as well as performance of the gateway.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the 3.0 version update of the Kong API Gateway, the routing system was completely rewritten in Rust â€” a memory-safe and efficient language. A concise DSL (Domain Specific Language) was designed to define routing rules efficiently, called the &amp;ldquo;Expressions Router.&amp;rdquo; The new design reduced the routing construction time by 75% when handling up to 10,000 routing rules, significantly decreasing from 20 seconds to 5 seconds.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
