# About Guanlan

Currently serve as Site Lead of Kong China and Director of Gateway at [Kong](https://konghq.com/).

As the founding engineering leader, I’ve helped evolve Kong from an open-source API gateway into a full-stack microservices platform — bridging open-source traction with enterprise adoption. I built Kong’s Shanghai engineering hub from the ground up, scaling it to a 50+ person team now driving innovation in API management and AI infrastructure for 700+ enterprise customers.

Before Kong, I led edge engineering at [Cloudflare](http://cloudflare.com/), where I helped scale systems serving trillions of daily requests across CDN, WAF, and DDoS products.

Talk to me about distributed systems, resilient infra, and network scaling — the good stuff.
