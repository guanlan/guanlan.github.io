2010 developer's problem solving sequence:

1.Google   
For technical problems, definitely check Google and Wikipedia. Use Baidu more if you want to see adult product ads.  
  
2.Coworkers   
Ask coworkers for help. If your colleagues are helpful, technically skilled, and have encountered similar problems, their advice can be very valuable and might solve the problem immediately.  
  
3.StackOverflow   
Search for answers on programming help websites, or post questions if you can't find answers. There are quite a lot of helpful people, but it seems this site has more Java/.Net questions.  
  
4.RTFM   
Read the f*cking manual - check man pages in Linux or look up MSDN documentation. Manual documentation is usually well-organized and clear. However, the language is often too technical, which can be frustrating sometimes.  
  
5.Think   
If all else fails, think about how to solve the problem yourself. Self-reliance is better than depending on others.
