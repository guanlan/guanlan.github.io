Firefox is not perfect, not the most stable, not without vulnerabilities, and not the fastest, but it can be yours.   
  

  
I really like this quote. It's because of the rich and colorful add-ons that Firefox has become so popular.  
The following add-ons are my personal favorites, and I recommend them to everyone!  
  

## 1.ColorfulTabs 

## 

People can distinguish colors much faster than text. This add-on generates tab colors based on the page's main color scheme, making your tabs colorful. Not only is it pleasing to the eye, but it also makes it easier to switch to the tab you want.

##  2.All-in-One Gestures

## 

These days, can you survive without mouse gestures? This add-on operates quickly and is highly customizable!

## 3.AutoProxy

A very smart and useful plugin to bypass the GF.W. It supports tor, proxy, and ssh very well. The best feature is that you can subscribe to rules to decide which pages use proxy and which don't need to. Harmonious society, harmonious you and me!

## 4.Readability

When a page is cluttered and difficult to read, just one click works like magic. The entire page becomes clean and attractive, even feeling like reading a beautifully formatted newspaper/novel.

## 5.Tab Popup 

When you hover your mouse over different tabs, it displays a thumbnail preview of that page.

## 6.Adblock Plus

Ads are history! Say goodbye to all kinds of annoying pop-ups.

## 7.Vimperator 

Makes your Firefox as comfortable as vim, suitable for hardcore vimmers!

## 9.Integrated Gmail

## 

A must-have for Google enthusiasts, integrating other Google features into Gmail. All your Google Needs in One Place!   
[Add-on link](https://addons.mozilla.org/zh-CN/firefox/addon/9457/)  
  
Similar ones include another [Google Reader optimization add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6424/), and a [Google products shortcuts add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3576/)

PS:  
Too many add-ons will of course slow down Firefox. Disable some add-ons you don't use frequently based on your needs.  
Also, Firefox 3.6.6 mainly improves the time to terminate plugins after they crash or stop responding. Friends who like installing add-ons should update now!
